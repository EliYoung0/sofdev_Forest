Forest Canopy Photograph Analysis Program
=======

This project was created with the goal of making a Java program capable of implementing various algorithms to analyze forest canopy photos and calculate various metrics including gap fraction and ISF to be used in the study of the effects of sunlight on plant growth.

## Installation
1. Download Forest.jar file from the github repository.
2. Install java from this website if you do not already have it installed: [https://www.java.com/en/download/]

## Usage
1. Open jar file
2. Select one or more jpg files to use or select a folder containing at least one jpg by using the browse button
or by entering the file path into the address bar.
3. After proceeding to the next screen enter the image's center x, and center y pixel as well as the radius side of the
image.
4. Press the draw circle button to display the image border and re-enter values if the border is off.
5. Enter the direction of north and press the draw north button to display the direction of north.
6. When satisfied press the save & continue button to proceed to the thresholding screen.
7. Select the algorithm you would like to use to threshold the image and wait for the black & white image to be displayed.
8. When satisfied press the save & continue button to proceed to the thresholding screen.
9. At this point a dialog window will appear to get the location of where to save the csv file.
10. Select the location of where to save the csv file either by using the file browser to go to a directory and enter a
.csv file name or type the path into the address bar.
11. Then press save to confirm this path and proceed to batch processing if more than one file selected or finish.
Or press cancel to go back to the thresholding screen.
12. If you have more than one file to process, press the start processing button to start batch processing.
13. When the batch processing button has completed, the finish and exit button will become clickable. Click this to close
the program.
